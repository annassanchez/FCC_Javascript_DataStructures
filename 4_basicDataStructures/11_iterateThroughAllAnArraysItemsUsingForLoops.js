//when working with arrays, it is very handy to be able to iterate through each item to find one or more elements that we might need or to manipulate an array based on which data items meet a certain set of criteria
//js offers several built in methods to achieve different results (evey(), forEach(), map())
//the technique which is most flexible and offers the greatest amount of control are for loops
